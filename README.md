A computer vision-based auto-fishing bot for Minecraft.

I used OpenCV + PyAutoGUI

I tried out several prototypes of drawing on top the screen with click-through. Pygame works the best (see examples/pgame.py). Eventually settled for OpenCV just for ease of implementation.

### Get Started

1. Open the application
2. Put the application aside, put your window's focus on Minecraft.
3. Align the greenbox on the **Fishing Bob**
4. Press **[Left Ctrl]** to get started, tracking will then start.

### How to Quit

1. Focus on the application window (Not Minecraft)
2. Press **[Q]**

### How to Restart

1. You can press and hold **[Left Ctrl]** anytime you want to reset the tracking

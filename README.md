# ðŸŽ£ McFisher

A computer vision-based auto-fishing bot for Minecraft.

I used OpenCV + PyAutoGUI

I tried out several prototypes of drawing on top the screen with click-through. Pygame works the best (see examples/pgame.py). Eventually settled for OpenCV just for ease of implementation.

### Get Started

1. Make sure you have MINECRAFT opened already!
1. Open the application
1. Put the application aside, put your window's focus on Minecraft.
1. Align the greenbox on the **Fishing Bob**
1. Press **[Left Ctrl]** to get started, tracking will then start.

### How to Quit

1. Focus on the application window (Not Minecraft)
2. Press **[Q]**

### How to Restart

1. You can press and hold **[Left Ctrl]** anytime you want to reset the tracking
